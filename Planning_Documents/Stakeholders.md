# **Personas:**

**Name:** Alan Watkins  
**Age:** 45  
**Home Town:** Boulder, Colorado  
**Occupation:** High School Science Teacher  
**Disability/Condition:** Colorblindness (Red-Green deficiency \- Deuteranopia)  
**Hobbies:** Watching nature documentaries, hiking, photography (uses grayscale editing), and science fiction novels.

Alan is a dedicated and passionate science teacher who lives in Boulder, Colorado. Diagnosed with colorblindness at an early age, Alan has always adapted to his condition by relying on text descriptions, grayscale images, and clear, accessible color palettes. Outside of teaching, he enjoys hiking in the Rocky Mountains, where he focuses on enjoying the shapes and textures of nature rather than the colors. Photography has been his creative outlet, and he primarily works with black-and-white filters.

Alan recently signed up for the streaming service to enjoy nature documentaries and science fiction movies during his downtime. However, he often struggles with websites that don’t consider colorblindness. Buttons and text links that rely solely on color distinctions frustrate him, as do movie ratings and charts without texture or text differentiation.

**Age**: 72  
**Hometown**: Des Moines, Iowa

**Background**: 

Harold is a retired educator who dedicated over 40 years of his life to teaching and administration.

However, as he has aged, his eyesight has worsened, and he now struggles with reading small text and navigating complex interfaces.
